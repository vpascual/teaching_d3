# Teaching D3
Repository with examples to teach D3.js

Here is a list of links to get an overall flavor of what D3.js is about and how to setup our system to run it locally.

The homepage of D3js is the place to start for having a broad understanding about how the library works: https://d3js.org (la introducci√≥n que hay en la home)

Selections are, probably, the most important elements to understand in D3. They're nicely explained in this section:

A vast amount of D3 examples can be found here: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery

To setup and install the library you can found a good tutorial here: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki#browser--platform-support
